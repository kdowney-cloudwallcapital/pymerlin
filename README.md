# pymerlin

This project offers a simple client wrapper for the [Merlin](https://mymerlin.io/dashboard) DeFi P&L [API](https://valk-1.gitbook.io/merlin-v2-api-documentation/welcome/merlin-intro). It is supported by [Cloudwall](https://cloudwall.tech) and freely available to the community.

# Getting started

In order to call the API you will need to set up a free API account at the [API portal](https://api.mymerlin.io/); this will give an initial balance of API usage credits; you can top up with credit card or USDC via Coinbase Wallet. You can also use the portal to copy or reset your API key.

### Installation

Installation for Python 3.x users is very simple using pip:

```plain
pip install pymerlin
```

If you have already installed `pymerlin` and want to upgrade to latest:

```plain
pip install -U pymerlin
```
